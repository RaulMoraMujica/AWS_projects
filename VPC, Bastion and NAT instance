VPC, Bastion and NAT instance.

The goal is to configure a VPC with one private and one public subnet. 
In the private subnet we have one EC2 which will be used to ping a website.
In the public subnet we will have two EC2 instances, one as a NAT instance and
the other one as a BASTION. All this inside one availability zone
I propose a step by step method to achieve the objective.

1. Create one Key Pair.

- Go to the AWS console.
- Click on EC2.
- Search for Key Pair on resources, and create one.
- This will be used afterwards.

2. Create a VPC with NAT Instance.

- Go to VPC now.
- Start VPC Wizard.
- Choose the option "VPC with Public and Private Subnets"
- On "VPC name", give it a name.
- You have the subnets below. Configure both to the same availability zone.
- You can change their names too.
- About IPv4, let them as they are.
- Let's "use a NAT instance instead".
	- Instance type: t2.micro
	- Key Pair name: use your Key pair.

3. Configuring NAT Instance security group. Door to the internet!

- Go to Instance inside EC2.
- We have here one instance, inside "Name", just name it "NAT Instance".
- Look at the column "Security Group" and click on "default".
- Now select it and change the name to "NAT security" and go to inbound tab.
- Click on "edit".
- Go to inbound Rules and click edit.
	- For type, search for "all traffic".
- Click Save

4. Create Bastion Host in Public Subnet.
- Services -> EC2 -> Launch Instance.
- Select windows server 2016 base (free tier).
- Choose an instance type: t2.micro free tier.
- Configure instance details
	- Network: your VPC.
	- Subnet: the public one.
	- Auto-assign public ip: enable.
- Add storage: next
- Add Tags:
	- key: name
	- Value: Bastion Host
- Configure Security Group:
	- Create a new one.
	- Change the name and description.
	- Type: All traffic

5. Create a EC2 instance in the private subnet.
- Services -> EC2 -> Launch Instance.
- Select windows server 2016 base (free tier).
- Choose an instance type: t2.micro free tier.
- Configure instance details
	- Network: your VPC.
	- Subnet: the private one.
	- Auto-assign public ip: disable.
- Add storage: next
- Add Tags:
	- key: name
	- Value: "Private server"
- Configure Security Group:
	- Create a new one.
	- Change the name and description.
	- Type: All traffic

6. Ping google.com ip from the private subnet.
- Copy the private ip of the private instance, it looks like "10.0.0.255"
- Go to instances, select Bastion and connect.
- It will ask for your .pem key.
- Now you are inside the bastion host, then you look for remote desktop connection.
- Paste the ip and it will ask for the key again. You are inside the private server.
- Open command prompt 
- Type "ping" and the the ip address for google.com 64.233.191.255
- Enter
